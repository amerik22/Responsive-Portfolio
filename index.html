    <div class="about">
    <p>  I am orginally from the Chicago area and moved to Denver in 2015. I have been working in marketing for over 10 years. 
       In more recent postions I have gotten the chance to learn basic HTML for editing webpages and emails. I found that the most enjoyable part of my day was when I was coding.
       So I have decided to deepen my knowledge and change my career path towards web development.  </p>

    <p>What draws me to web development is the opprtunity to have a career where I can be a forever learner. Getting the chance to learn everyday 
     makes for a fulfuling and long career. I also enjoy that a large part of the job is problem solving. 
     There is nothing more exciting when you see your code come to life!  </p>

     <p>In my spare time I love to hike, check out live music, binge shows on netflix, and cook, eat and drink all the yummy things.</p>
